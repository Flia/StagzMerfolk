    <description>A hermit xenotype that comes from the ocean. Despite being fierce and graceful fighters in the water, they like to swim aimlessly and sing on reef rocks in hopes of finding a love for life. They are apparently a friendly race towards other humanoids, as many survivors of space shipwreck on ocean planets have reported being saved by coastal merfolks.</description>

However, they are usually hostile toward non-merfolks as their habitat is scarce of resources. It is said they wield the power of rain with sea fret and storms being common in their presence.</description>
